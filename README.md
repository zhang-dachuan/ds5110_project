### Overview
According to the CDC, someone has a stroke every 40 seconds and dies of it every 4 minutes in the US.
Suffering from a stroke can lead to lasting brain damage, long-term disability, or even death. We wanted
to understand if certain physiological and lifestyle factors could impact the occurrence of stroke as well
as investigate if we can accurately predict whether a person is likely to have a stroke. Relationships or
findings between the different factors and the incidence of stroke were examined using visualizations in
R. Furthermore, the project aimed to develop a supervised machine learning model to predict stroke
likelihood in a patient given these factors.

### Goals
Through analysis of this dataset, our goals were twofold:
1. To find any apparent relationships between different physiological or lifestyle factors provided,
and the incidence of stroke.
2. Develop a model that could accurately predict what factors may lead to a stroke.
The identification and analysis of factors linked with stroke can lead to enhanced preventative healthcare
for patients who are determined to be at a higher risk. The exploration of this dataset, and a strong
predictive model may lead to better healthcare outcomes for patients.
With regards to our second goal of developing a stroke prediction model, our hypotheses are as follows:
Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant relationship between stroke status and any factors.
Alternative Hypothesis (Ha): There exists a relationship between stroke status and a combination of
physiological and lifestyle factors.

### Dataset Description
A publicly available Kaggle dataset that has tracked the incidence of stroke with other factors was used
for our analysis. In total, 12 attributes are tracked, including physiological factors such as a patient's BMI,
average glucose level, smoking status, the presence of heart disease and/or hypertension. It also includes
a patient's demographic data, including their age, gender, the type of work they do, their residence type,
and marital status. There are over 43,000 observations of unique patients in the data where 42,617 have
not had a stroke, and 783 have had a stroke.
